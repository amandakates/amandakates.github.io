  <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>

  <h2>About me!</h2>
    <p>I am Amanda Kate, and I am a student at Harvard studying pre-law. I am originally from Madison, Wisconsin but I love my life in Cambridge. I have always loved reading lifestyle blogs, so I decided it was about time to make my own. I love to surf, walk my dog, and hangout with my friends.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in visiting Cambridge, or in applying to Harvard, please visit: <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/on-campus/visit-harvard" target="_blank" >www.visitharvard.com</a></p>

  <h2>Lifestyle...Fashion, Cooking, Travel!</h2>
    <p>Since this is a lifestyle blog, you can expect to read information about my passion for fashion, cooking, and travel. Within each of these pages, you will find more information about my personal style, my favorite recipes, and recent trips of mine:</p>
